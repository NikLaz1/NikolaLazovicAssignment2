# Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

1) Navbar was added and made to re-size upon a certain dimension.
2) Responsive images in the form of card were added into the contact info portion of the website. When toggled in different sizes and layouts, the card responded accordingly and re sized to fit the screen without layout issues. 
3) Portfolio was updated with some of the acitivities that we've worked on in class, they were href-ed into he buttons so that the user can easily access and try them out.
4) No Media Queries were used in making this webpage. The re-sizing was configured using the responsive classes of the corresponding bootstrap elements. 
5) Bootstrap's grid system was integrated as well with regards to certain elements.
6) The footer is more form than function at the moment. It is a proof of concept and the href's were left empty for that purpose. I will build out every href as I go through the course so that it becomes a legitimate porfolio for employment purposes. However that being said, the footer fulfills the responsive requirements and is ready to be made functional.
